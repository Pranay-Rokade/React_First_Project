# TextUtils - React First Project

## Overview

**TextUtils** is a simple and powerful text utility tool built using React and Bootstrap CSS. This project showcases various text transformation and analysis features, as well as a user-friendly interface with light and dark mode options.

This is my first React project, and I built it from scratch while learning React with Bootstrap. ðŸš€
